# No API key is required for open-source models like Hugging Face Transformers.
# Here is an example using Hugging Face's transformers library with a local or hosted model.

# from transformers import pipeline
# import torch

# # Load a conversational pipeline with a suitable model for question answering
# qa_pipeline = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")  # You can use other models as well

# def ask_bot(query):
#     prompt = f"Answer the following question about stock prediction:\n{query}"
#     response = qa_pipeline(prompt, max_length=150, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7)
#     return response[0]['generated_text'][len(prompt):].strip()
